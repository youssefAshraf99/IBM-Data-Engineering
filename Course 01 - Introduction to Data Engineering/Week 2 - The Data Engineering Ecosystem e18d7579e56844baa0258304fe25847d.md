# **Types of Data**

![Untitled](Week%202%20-%20The%20Data%20Engineering%20Ecosystem%20e18d7579e56844baa0258304fe25847d/Untitled%2010.png)

## Structured data

- Has a well-defined structure
- Can be stored in well-defined schemas
- Can be represented in a tabular manner with rows and columns

![Untitled](Week%202%20-%20The%20Data%20Engineering%20Ecosystem%20e18d7579e56844baa0258304fe25847d/Untitled%2011.png)

## Semi-Structured data

- Has some organizational properties but lacks a fixed or rigid schema
- Cannot be stored in the forms of rows and columns as in databases
- Contains tags and elements, or metadata, which is used to griup data and organize it in a hierarchy

## Unstructured data

- Does not have an easily identifiable structure
- Cannot be organized in a mainstream relational database in the form of rows and columns
- Does not follow any particular format, sequence, semantics, or rules

## Conclusion

Structured data is data that is well organized in formats that can be stored in databases and lends itself to standard data analysis methods and tools; 

Semi-structured data is data that is somewhat organized and relies on meta tags for grouping and hierarchy; 

Unstructured data is data that is not conventionally organized in the form of rows and columns in a particular format. In the next video, we will learn about the different types of file structures.

# **Summary and Highlights**

A Data Engineer’s ecosystem includes the infrastructure, tools, frameworks, and processes for extracting data, architecting and managing data pipelines and data repositories, managing workflows, developing applications, and managing BI and Reporting tools.

Based on how well-defined the structure of the data is, data can be categorized as

- Structured data, that is data which is well organized in formats that can be stored in databases.
- Semi-structured data, that is data which is partially organized and partially free-form.
- Unstructured data, that is data which can not be organized conventionally into rows and columns.

Data comes in a wide-ranging variety of file formats, such as, delimited text files, spreadsheets, XML, PDF, and JSON, each with its own list of benefits and limitations of use.

Data is extracted from multiple data sources, ranging from relational and non-relational databases, to APIs, web services, data streams, social platforms, and sensor devices.

Once the data is identified and gathered from different sources, it needs to be staged in a data repository so that it can be prepared for analysis. The type, format, and sources of data influence the type of data repository that can be used.

Data professionals need a host of languages that can help them extract, prepare, and analyse data. These can be classified as:

- Querying languages, such as SQL, used for accessing and manipulating data from databases.
- Programming languages such as Python, R, and Java, for developing applications and controlling application behavior.
- Shell and Scripting languages, such as Unix/Linux Shell, and PowerShell, for automating repetitive operational tasks.
